# 2D Multiplayer Metaverse

A simple real-time 2D metaverse built using Phaser and Socket.IO.
Players can move around a shared office map, see other players in real time,
and interact through proximity-based chat.

This project is built as a learning-focused multiplayer prototype through socket.io and phaser game engine .
My main focus was to learn  socket.io to send real time location and real time chat in thsi project
